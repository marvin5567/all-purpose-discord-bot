All Purpose Discord Bot
--
The main purpose of this project is to test a lot of features through the medium of discord's bot capabilities in Python. The goal is to cram as many useful tools in this bot, ranging from artificial intelligence (i.e. the stock prediction feature), to ethical hacking tools (i.e. OSINT data collection tools). 

Jumps to each section:

- [General Discord Bot Functionalities](#general-discord-bot-functionalities)
- [AI Features](#ai-features)
- [Ethical Hacking Features](#ethical-hacking-features)


*Note: The discord bot is written using `interactions.py` instead of `discord.py`. No real reason as to why, I just find it easier lmao.*

this is a W.I.P. portfolio project, so if you're watching this hello! i appreciate any comments, feedback or advice on this project as it develops.
