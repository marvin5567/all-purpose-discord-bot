Stocks Discord Bot
--
The main purpose of this project is to learn and understand machine/deep learning concepts and applying it to stocks to tell the user when its a good time to invest in the stock or not. Applying this to a discord bot allows for an easy way for the user to be notified of such changes.

*Note: The discord bot is written using `interactions.py` instead of `discord.py`. No real reason as to why, I just find it easier lmao.*

this is a W.I.P. portfolio project, so if you're watching this hello! i appreciate any comments, feedback or advice on this project as it develops.
